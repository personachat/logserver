# PersonaChat Log Server
The log server for PersonaChat. Users can upvote conversations. The upvoted conversations will be sent to the log server to be added to the training dataset, after a safety and quality review.
## The log server has been combined with the webUI! [Check out the webUI](https://codeberg.org/personachat/webui)
